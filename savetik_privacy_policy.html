  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 24, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to SaveTik, a mobile application developed and maintained by DuruSoft. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when using our services.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>SaveTik is a utility application designed to allow users to download public video and audio content using valid media URLs, particularly from TikTok. The app does not require user registration and does not collect personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>We <strong>do not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> directly. However, our application integrates third-party services that may collect limited data, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (for regional ad delivery)</li>
    <li>App usage statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services include Google AdMob, Google Play Billing, and Crashlytics.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertising formats such as banners, interstitials, and native ads. These services may use cookies and mobile identifiers to provide personalized ads and track performance.</p>
  <p>For more on how Google handles your data, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>SaveTik offers premium features through weekly, monthly, and yearly subscriptions. All transactions are handled securely by Google Play Billing. We do not access or store any payment details.</p>

  <h2>5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under this age.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Although we do not collect personal data, we take reasonable precautions to ensure the application and its dependencies (e.g., ads, subscriptions) operate securely.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>As a user, you may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opt out of personalized ads via device settings</li>
    <li>Request data deletion from third-party SDKs where applicable</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may include links or integrations with external services (such as TikTok). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party platforms.</p>

  <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be posted within the app or on our support page. Continued use of the app implies your agreement with the updated policy.</p>
