    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Status Saver - Save Download</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Status Saver - Save Download app (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) handles user information and protects your privacy. We understand the importance of your personal data and are fully committed to maintaining transparency, integrity, and security.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not collect</strong> or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from users of the app. All features of the app—including viewing, downloading, or managing WhatsApp status files—are handled locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app integrates Google AdMob to serve advertisements. While we do not share any data ourselves, AdMob may collect information (e.g., device information, ad interactions) to personalize ads in accordance with their own privacy policy. We do not have control over their data handling mechanisms.</p>

    <p>You can learn more about AdMob’s data practices here:  
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To deliver its core functionality, the app may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Storage Access</strong> – To read and save media files from your WhatsApp statuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Network Access</strong> – To serve advertisements and check connectivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Notification Access</strong> – To alert users about saved statuses (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely to provide a seamless user experience and are not abused or accessed beyond their intended purpose.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware of any such data being inadvertently collected, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While no app can guarantee complete security, we make every effort to ensure that your usage remains local, anonymous, and private. No external database or cloud is used to store user data.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in legal or operational requirements. Any such changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
